# How to work with our setup

## Branching model
We use the Gitflow branching model, described here: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

All bug fixes / feature requests should be based off the development branch unless your fix is a hotfix for production.

## Workflow model
We use the Integration Manager workflow described here: http://git-scm.com/book/en/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows

You should fork our main repo and submit pull requests from your repository.  This keeps things cleaner and prevents
major issues if someone accidentally rebases something wrong ;-)
